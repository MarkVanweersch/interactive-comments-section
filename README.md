## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla JS
- PHP
- MySQL
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was the first full-stack web application I built. For this I learned how to use set up a local webserver running PHP and MySQL. I learned what PHP and MySQL are and how they can be used to make a web application. What I mostly learned was the fundamentals of PHP and MySQL, as well as getting better at manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about PHP and MySQL. Using these together with JS, you can make some awesome web apps.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for learning PHP and MySQL as well as generally looking up syntaxes.
- [Dani Krossing](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCharmefis) - Dani has a tutorial series on how to work with PHP and MySQL. For this project and my personal portfolio I learned a lot from him.
